# DAI - Lab 4 - Mock TCP client application to send prank e-mails using SMTP #
 
## Description of our project ##
if people exploring GitHub find your repo, without a prior knowledge of the API
course, they should be able to understand what your repo is all about and whether they should look at it more closely.

## Instructions for setting up your mock SMTP server ##
The user who wants to experiment with your tool but does not really
want to send pranks immediately should be able to use a mock SMTP server.

## Configuring the tool and running a prank campaign ##
If you do a good job, an external
user should be able to clone your repo, edit a couple of files and send a batch of e-mails in less than 10 minutes.

## Description of our implementation ##
document the key aspects of your code. It is a good idea to start with a class
diagram. Decide which classes you want to show (focus on the important ones) and describe their responsibilities in text.
It is also certainly a good idea to include examples of dialogues between your client and an SMTP server
(maybe you also want to include some screenshots here).
